<h1>About Me</h1>

Hello everyone! I'm a senior student and a -soon to be- computer engineer. I graduated from Istanbul Ataturk Science High School at 2010 and started here. I've also been a student assistant for Cmpe150 course for 5 semesters. So I can say that I'm good at C, C++ and Java. I'm also good at motorbiking and I hope I will be also good at playing accordion (I'm just a beginner :))<br>
<br>
Thank you for your reading, hope it helps you to know me at least a little bit! :)<br>
