## Abstract ##

The main purpose of our project is to create a social awareness and networking environment that provides people reporting when violations are encountered and search, rate and comment on these violations. This application basically allows individuals to know what is going on about the violations that people encounter. Also our application is taking into consideration that not all the violations impact all disable people. Some violations affect those who can't walk, some affect those who can't see, or hear etc. All in all, an accessible environment is a shared responsibility, and this application is trying to help people about that.
