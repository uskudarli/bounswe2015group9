# About Me #

Hi, I am a backend developer at vngrs. I am also a senior student at CMPE. It's my 6th year here and 4th time for me to get this course. Personally i've been involved in 4 different real money making projects. 3 of them are startups but somehow i've no idea how to develop in a team according to this course.

Besides these, I like climbing,mountaineering and video games.

I have to add that we are looking for scala, rails and android developers at vngrs. if you are interested, do not hesitate to contact.
